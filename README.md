Python based ontology specification language, with tools
========================================================

The Python Ontology Specfication Lanaguage (pyosl) provides the documentation and implementation
of a methodology, with tools, for manipulating an ontology expressed in python according to a
metamodel documented in this package.

It should be used with one or more ontologies, defined in python as described in the 
documentation, and identified via the configuration.
